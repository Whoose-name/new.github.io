<h1><u><i>Ficus</i></u></h1>
<h3>(fig)</h3>
<p>
•Ficus is a genus of about 850 species of woody trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in the family Moraceae. 
<br>•It's known as fig trees or figs, they are native throughout the tropics with a few species extending into the semi-warm temperate zone.
<br>•The common fig (F. carica) is a temperate species native to southwest Asia and the Mediterranean region (from Afghanistan to Portugal), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its fruit, also referred to as figs. 
<br>•The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as bushfood
</p>
<h2>USES:-</h2>
<p>
1)There are several varieties of Ficus plants, which have purple fruits called figs. These are packed with nutrients and associated with many health benefits. Common fig (Ficus Carica) is cultivated for its pear-shaped edible fruits, which are nutritious and aid in digestion, decrease the risk of heart diseases, and help manage blood sugar levels.
<br>2)Ficus or fig tree is home to birds, butterflies, monkeys, and bats.
<br>3)Ficus plants also purify air by filtering toxins from it. They can filter out pollutants such as formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene.
<br>4)Ficus fruits, roots, and leaves are used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as gastrointestinal indigestion, hemorrhoids, inflammatory conditions, loss of appetite, liver disorders, urinary diseases, diarrhea, diabetes, and respiratory and cardiovascular disorders. 
<br>5)Some Ficus trees are cultivated as a source of rubber and paper.
</p>
<h2>Cultural & Historical Importance:</h2>
<p>
<br>•There was widespread acknowledgement among the residents of Komargoan that fig trees are sacred. This finding is consistent with previous reports from the Indian Subcontinent (Chandrakanth et al. 1990; Dutta 2006; Gadgil and Guha 1993; Kumar et al. 2011; Sitaramam et al. 2009). We observed temples or shrines were common features at the base of large ahot gos (F. religiosa) and bor gos (F. benghalensis) trees. These ranged from large modern temples to small shrines, consisting of red banners as gifts to the gods or even posters depicting a god.
<br>•Figs are also of paramount cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many medicinal uses. The fig trees have profoundly influenced culture through several religious traditions namely in Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Islam

<h2>Plantation:-</h2>
<p><br><b>Watering</b>
<br><br>The Ficus plant prefers to dry out some between watering, but do not let the soil completely dry out. We recommend that you water your tree every 5 to 7 days, or when the top inch of soil is dry.
<br><br><b>Reproduction</b>
<br><br>The flowers are pollinated by very small wasps that crawl through the opening in search of a suitable place to lay eggs. Without this pollinator service fig trees could not reproduce by seed
<br><br><b>Location</b>
<br><br>Ficus trees are tropical plants but do well in indoor lighting conditions
<br><br><b>Temperature</b>
<br><br>80 degrees during the day to about 60 degrees at night.
<br><br><b>Diseases and pests</b>
<br><br>Ficus trees are vulnerable to pests such as mites, scale, mealybugs, whiteflies, and aphids, and can fall due to sudden changes in temperature, changing the location of the plant, or over-watering. To get rid of these pests, wash the plant directly under the tap or shower and repeat the process. If the leaves are falling, check if the soil is drained properly. Occasionally, Ficus trees can contract a leaf spot disease.
